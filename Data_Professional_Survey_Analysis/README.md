An analytical dashboard created for the "Data Professional Survey" dataset that I acquired from AlexTheAnalyst's PowerBI github repository (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI.git). I've also included this data into the "data/" folder of this project folder.

Screenshots displaying the below dashboard's insights are in the "screenshots/" folder.
